      <p>Thank you for looking into my portfolio.  I have recently attended UTSA full stack coding boot camp and I have Roger Le and two assistants to reach the point Iâ€™ve come to now.  </p>

      <p>The first thing I learned about coding is that there is so much to learn, and no matter how much you think you know, you never stop learning.  There are so many different programming languages that it can be overwhelming to even consider where to start!</p>

      <p>I believe my strong suits are HTML and CSS, and though they are the two most basic coding languages, they are the ones I have the most experience and confidence in, and I am always willing to learn more and improve my capabilities with JavaScript and React.  </p>
